# clickbait-title-generator
This is a Python script that generates random clickbait Youtube titles

# How to run

Open a terminal, navigate to the repo's dirrectory and run :
```python clickbaiter.py``` or ```python3 clickbaiter.py```
You can also add the number of titles as an argument : 
```python clickbaiter.py 10``` will return 10 random titles

# How to edit

I made this as easy as possible to edit, all you need to do is edit the files in the [wordlists dirrectory](wordlists/)
The [template_titles file](wordlists/template_titles) defines the base structure of the title, and elements preceded by ```$``` are replaced by text found in the file with the according name

# This code sucks

I know, I'm not that good with Python, so if you know better ways to achieve what I did, please let me know.
